# Lock it Down! IBM's Keys to Data Security Success

Presented by Melissa Gabriele - Security Technical Specialist

- Where does our data reside? Mainframe, cloud, probably an AI model somewhere => Distributed data
- Problem: Secure distributed data across to many infrastructures
- Who needs access to this data? Customers, employees, third parties => Users of Privilege
    - 82% of data breaches occured via UoP
- Threat actors use stolen credentials from UoP to infiltrate
- Average cost of a data breach: 4.88 million USD
- 77% of data breaches started with stolen credentials
- 3 different ways to solve:
    - DSPM
    - Governance
    - Data DR

## Data Security Posture Management

1. Visibility
2. Context
3. Accuracy
4. Movement - DR
5. Vulnerability Management (98% of breaches occurred in environments w/ known vulns)
6. Identity Intelligence Insights

## Governance

- Third Party
    - 62% of UoP attacks were from Third Parties
- Data:
    - Turn Policies into Rules
    - Mask data users don't need to see
- Data Security:
    - Compliance & Auditing

## Data Detection and Response

- Reduce mean time to response: avg 258 days
1. Activate Threat Analytics
2. Risk Scoring
3. Real Time Trust Evaluator

## Keys to Data Security Success

- Visiblity with Context: Know where data is and where most important data lies
- Holistic Governance Controls
- Proactive Response to Threats

## Q&A

- Can you label different types of data that may be tagged or untagged?
    - Can run scans to understand it and apply tags then.
