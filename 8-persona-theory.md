# Persona Theory: Infiltration & Deception of Emerging Threat Groups

Presented by Tammy Harper - Senior Threat Intelligence Researcher & Certified Dark Web Investigator

## Persona Theory

- Creating a persona: background, mannerism, any little thing you can curate
- Classical Cyber Threat Intelligence
    - Strategiac threat intelligence gives an overview of the organization's threat landscape
    - Tactital threat intelligence provide specific details on threat actors
- Dark Web Threat Intelligence

## The Mission

- Identify
- Probe
- Gather
- Verify
- Analyze

- Target Identification: Find groups in recruitment phase
    - They are actively seeking new participants
    - Infiltrating early gives access to initial hierarchy
    - Early involvement allows for disruption and potential collapse of the group (In-Fighting)
    - Identify key assets the group uses
    - Example: Apos, Cicada3301

- Initial contact: Probing the enemy
    - Leverage intelligence from posting, talk in English, try 3-5 accounts to get all the answers
    - Example: RaaS, REcycled Initial Access
        - Never ask people to resend files
        - Offer expertise and was already part of a team, higher chance of getting accepted
        - Recycle Psoglav name (a different hacker)
        - Offer initial access trade
    - Sometimes need to fail before you can succeed
        - First persona: not the main point of contact middleman, direct to the point, doesn't try to impress

- Family Tree Annihilation

## Sculpting the Persona

- Timezones: The Eastern Timezone Disadvantage
- Distribution:
    - Top countries according to LASTIP_GEO metrics on the leaked BreachForumsVI database:
        1. Indonesia
        2. USA
        3. Hong Kong...
- Timeshifting Personas & HoOA: Need a presence that has the same online time, thus might need to be done earlier
- Simplified Persona Motivations
    - Cybercrime: Financially Motivated
    - Hacktivism
- Writing Style
    - Mirror how they talk: aka a braindead, smooth-brained NPC gooner, fr fr no cap, yk?
- Languages: Threat Actors and other users can instantly tell who is a native speaker and who isn't
    - Transliteration: Converting text from one writing system to another, rather than translating the meaning => Weed out non-native speakers as most publicly available translation engines can't handle it
    - Slavic/Geographic Language Adjacency: Can suggest people speak in something else to sneak in machine translation

## Apos Infiltration

- Got them to open up on the taken down Notion website conversation
- Eventually got full builder access
- Still wanted an exit; how to get their files
- Began responding next and next

## Q&A

- What's it like to be the coolest?
    - Really love the job but put in so many hours in this line of work, living life like a lie and talking to a lot of people
- Worried about personal safety?
    - Operate through a custom-built rig, dedicated system, etc.
- You're basically a spy?
    - Do get approached by a lot of LEAs
- How do you go about identifying new threat groups? What do you do after infiltrating?
    - Get builder, admin panel access for screenshots, how they're building, who they're building, source code. Example: Playboy, they had overlapping source code with other big group
- Is it difficult to tell if a group rebranded or is just ripping off?
    - Implement codebase analysis, telemetric analysis, etc. to say if this person is the same or not
