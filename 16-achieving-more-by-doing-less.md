# Achieving More by Doing Less - How Burnout Prevention Can Improve Productivity

Presented by Matias Wengiel

## The problem

- Most of us work in a fast-paced environment
- A lot of us enjoy being busy
- We can do it for a two week sprint, and crush it
- We can do it for a month straight
- We can't do it forever
- If we refuse to stop, our bodies will force us to

## Burnout

- Chronic response to stress in the workplace
- Characterized by:
    - Exhaustion - Not just feeling tired
        - Physical Exhaustion
        - Mental Exhaustion
        - Emotional Exhaustion
        - THoughts like "I can't do this"
    - Depersonalization - Just a cog in the machine
        - Feelings of being a robot just going through the motions
        - Thoughts like "What did I even do all day? Why can't (coworker) get their shit together? I Am surrounded by incompetence"
    - Reduced Personal Accomplishment
- A potentially explosive mix
- Weakly correlated with introversion and extroversion, people may:
    - Explode: And everyone hears it
    - Implode: And they "disappear"
- and not just at work
    - Interpersonal conflict with family members
    - Exhaustion even when not at work
    - Decreased feelings of personal accomplishment in all areas of life
- How do I know if I'm experiencing burnout?
    - Feel frustrated and unsatisfied at work
    - Struggle to get through your day
    - Are having frequent arguments at work (or at home)
    - Find it hard to interact with people
- The limits of the human body
    - How long can you focus on a task non-stop?
    - Out of the 8 (...ish) hours we work every day, how many are we truly productive?
    - Our bodies were designed for hunting, gathering and all sorts of things we never do anymore

## The solution

- The human body is great at two things:
    - Short bursts of intense activity
    - Long stretches of moderate activity
- Leverage the strengths built into our body
- Avoid spending energy on low yield efforts
- Give yourself the best chance to be productive during your productivity window
- What works?
    - Creating the right environment for ourselves
    - Learn to notice the signs that your body is reaching its limit
    - And accept that the limits may vary from day to day
    - Learn to say no
    - Learn to accept when others say no to you
- Take a break so you can go home earlier
    - Take meaningful breaks (Stop thinking about work!)
    - Take enough breaks
    - Don't "multitask"
    - Find ways to reset from a "burst of intense activity" to allow you to do it again
- Mindfulness
    - Being present and "in the moment"
    - Accepting the ups and downs of the workplace
    - ...taking breaks
    - Little routines or rituals that ground you
- Pomodoro method
    - Blocks of 25 minutes of work followed by 5 minute breaks
    - A longer 15-30 minute break every 4 blocks of work

## Managing to increase productivity

- How to achieve more by doing less?
    - Limiting stretches of "above and beyond" effort for any one person (or team)
    - You won't get 40+ hours of productivity out of every worker every week
- Above and beyond
    - Teams should achieve their goals on time more often than not
    - If not, the goals (or the team) needs to change
    - The unexpected happens
        - It's fair to ask people to work hard
        - It's not fair to set that as the new baseline

## Summary

- Learn about your own limits
- Respect your limits
- Aim for achievement, not just being busy
- As a manager, reward high performing teams with normal periods, not just more high-intensity work

## Don't suffer in silence

- Talk to your family doctor
- Reach out to your workplaces' EAP, or a professional therapist
- matiaswengiel@gmail.com - feel free to reach out if you'd like to talk about burnout (or anything else)

## Q&A

- How much of burnout is perception, the work culture, etc.?
    - Burnout is scientifically proven, but environment is a big factor; some people do quit their jobs. That's why need to manage people's workload.
- Working your wages?
    - That's fair
- What if someone identifies with the burnout despite having normal periods and supportive work culture?
    - You can do everything right and still experience burnout; get help and talk it out
- Is there evidence that EAP sessions over phone and virtually is same as in person?
    - Unsure scientifically, but if client feels okay over the phone then it's okay
- How do you know if someone's burning out or being a little lazy?
    - Ideally you know the people you work with enough to know they aren't lazy - if you know they're lazy then just fire them, but you need to talk to them; some people when burning out will just become a little lazy
- Prevent burnout as a manager?
    - Manage workload reasonably; even if higher-ups put pressure, learn to say no
- How to encourage really high-performant people to chill out?
    - Tell them first so they don't think they're fired; put them on vacation
