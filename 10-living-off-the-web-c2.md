mathieu saulnier living off the web C2

building a c2 framework but needed to find a programming language figured out rust would be a good option. tried to figure out how to put github into rust files and realized it needed to do it manually in the program. asked ChatGPT to write a function for deleting a branch built many repositories 

learning rust is hard

anti IR strategies

use random filename for come
use branches for output

notes on github: trying to delete something on github there will always be a copy somewhere.

cross compilation 

node and the server was done on mac using rust programming language 

compiling a linux version you need a openSSL in your compilation folder

preventing the node from crashing 

this is a BIG problem 
since rust prefers to crash instead of overflowing
